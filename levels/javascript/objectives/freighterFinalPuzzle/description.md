Beyond the barrier, you can see the TwilioQuest research team's **electrical engineer**! She has one of the activation codes you need to restart the ducktypium experiment. However, she is still trapped behind a barrier that is different from the others aboard the **Infinite Loop**.

This barrier requires a special 6-letter **master password**. The clues you need to decipher the password can be found by exploring the rest of the ship, and hacking into the **security nodes** present in the ship's six secure cargo holds. Once you have hacked all six security nodes, you may return here and attempt to guess the password.

## Deciphering the password

The **Infinite Loop**'s master password is six characters long. Each character in the password can be found in the following [two-dimensional array](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/javascript-multi-dimensional-arrays-7186e8edd03).

```js
const passwordArray = [
  ["Q", "W", "E", "R", "T", "Y"],
  ["A", "S", "D", "F", "G", "H"],
  ["Z", "X", "C", "V", "B", "N"],
  ["U", "I", "O", "P", "!", "@"],
  ["H", "J", "K", "L", "#", "$"],
  ["M", "%", "^", "&", "*", "?"],
];
```

Each **security node** inside the freighter contains an index within this array for one character of the password. The index will be given to you in the form `[x][y]`, where `x` is the numerical index of the "row" the character is in, and `y` is the numerical index of the "column" the character is in. Here are the indexes you have found so far:
<%
// Password is "F!N!TE"
const nodes = worldState.eastWingSecNodes || [];
const ii = [
nodes[0] ? '`[1][3]`' : 'Not Found',
nodes[1] ? '`[3][4]`' : 'Not Found',
nodes[2] ? '`[2][5]`' : 'Not Found',
nodes[3] ? '`[3][4]`' : 'Not Found',
nodes[4] ? '`[0][4]`' : 'Not Found',
nodes[5] ? '`[0][2]`' : 'Not Found'
];
%>

| 1st Char     | 2nd Char     | 3rd Char     | 4th Char     | 5th Char     | 6th Char     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| <%= ii[0] %> | <%= ii[1] %> | <%= ii[2] %> | <%= ii[3] %> | <%= ii[4] %> | <%= ii[5] %> |

Once you have found all six indexes, return here and use them to decipher the password!
