You enter the east wing of the lab, which appears to be an airlock used by freight-carrying vessels. The **research team's engineer** must have been trapped aboard the supply ship after the explosion in the lab!

Scanning recent shipping manifests, you see that the freighter currently docked with the station is called the **Infinite Loop**. Its systems are controlled by JavaScript logic that uses [arrays](https://javascript.info/array), or lists of items. The control mechanisms blocking your path will require you to write JavaScript code that uses arrays in a variety of ways.

## Taking inventory of the situation

This laser barrier was engaged after the **Infinite Loop's** cargo inventory was accidentally erased. You'll need to fix it to progress further.

Create a file called `freighterInventory.js` in your code folder. Inside this file, declare a variable called `inventory`. This variable should contain an array with the following five [strings](https://javascript.info/string), in order.

- `"Ducktypium Ore"`
- `"Uranium Rod"`
- `"Ruthenium Isotopes"`
- `"Concave Lens"`
- `"Refraction Panel"`

Once your code creates a variable called `inventory` with the items above, click the *HACK* button.
