# Objective Help

All the challenges in this area require you to master the concept of [arrays](https://javascript.info/array). An array is a list of objects in a particular order. [Check out the array reference on MDN for more information](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

To complete this objective, create a file called `freighterInventory.js` in your code folder. Your code folder is located here:

`<%= env.TQ_JAVASCRIPT_WORKSPACE_PATH.value %>`

Inside `freighterInventory.js`, you will need to declare an array variable called `inventory` as described in the objective. It should contain five strings, in the same order they are listed on the previous tab. Once you have done this, click *HACK* to validate!
