The second seal of the airlock is blocked off by another security barrier. The JavaScript code that you'll need to fix here is a function that processes shipping manifests - specifically, there is a function that takes an array of strings as an argument, and returns a new string which is the result of sticking the first and last items of the array together.

You'll need to get this function working properly before you can enter the **Infinite Loop**.

Create a file called `addFirstToLast.js` in your code folder. In it, define a function of the same name, called `addFirstToLast`. This function should take one argument - an array of strings. 

Your function should return a string, which is the first and last items in the input array, concatenated together. Some example code you can use as a starting point is provided in the "Help" tab.

Here are some example inputs and outputs:

| Input                        | Output           |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| ['first', 'second', 'third'] | 'firstthird'     |
| ['golden', 'terrier']        | 'goldenterrier'  |
| ['cheerio']                  | 'cheeriocheerio' |
| [ ]                           | ''               |

Once your code can process the array as described above, click the *HACK* button to move forward!
